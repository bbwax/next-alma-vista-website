      review: "My family and I had a wonderful stay here. It fit the ten of us comfortably and gave us a good place to detach from the world and enjoy each others company. Would definitely come back.",

        review: "My partner and I booked this house for an anniversary trip and we had such a great time during our stay! Nothing beats stargazing in a hot tub after a day of swimming at Pinecrest Lake (~30 min drive) or hiking through Yosemite (~1.5 hr drive) :) The house perfectly matched the description and we were more than happy with the location. Thanks Braxton and Jasmine for the stay! We highly recommend it to anyone looking to book in the area",

        review: "Wonderful home that is centrally located to many activities. Home was very comfortable and well suited for a family trip. The best part was the spectacular view. Sunrise and sunsets on the deck were beautiful!",

        review: "Braxton was super responsive when I texted him with a couple questions. Alma Vista is a clean comfortable place to stay. The cabin had all amenities that a visitor could want or need. It was great! I worked from the cabin all week the internet was fast and reliable. The TV room was awesome! Overall it was a 10/10. Great all around. We had a wonderful week!",

        review: "This house is very cozy. Peaceful. Escape from reality. Feel so home. Cleaned. Nice views from a big patio. If you want to go to casino- go to Black Oak Casino Resort (13 mins of driving). If you want to go to lake- go to Pinecrest Lake. (35 mins of driving) Iâ€™ll definitely be back to this house again.",

        review: "This was a perfect fit for our needs - close to our daughter's home, lots of options for bedding for our extended family, well-equipped kitchen, gorgeous view from the outside deck. Sort of a 1970s retro style, clean and uncluttered. We'll be back!",

        review: "We had a great weekend at Braxton's place! We enjoyed the views, the hot tub, and the theater room. We all also thought the beds were really comfortable. The area was pretty quiet and peaceful. Braxton was really responsive and answered all our questions. We would definitely love to stay again in the future.",

        review: "The location is spectacular with amazing views. The house is beautiful and is as shown in pictures and description. Hosts are very responsive and accommodating. Close to 108 and short distance to Sonora for groceries and nice restaurants. Overall highly recommend this property and location.",
