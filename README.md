# Alma Vista Rental Home Website

This [website](https://almavistacabin.com) showcases a beautiful short-term rental home and provides users with the capability to directly book their stay using the integrated [IGMS widget](https://www.igms.com/). Built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), the platform offers a seamless user experience and is backed by [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for data persistence. The [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) integration further aids users in identifying the home's location and its surroundings. The website is deployed and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
